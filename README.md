## This is the code for the my graduation thesis.

### Our implementation consists of 4 subexperiments:
- [Domain adaptation](da-code)
- [Domain generalization](dg-code)
- [Semi supervised learning](ssl-code)
- [Adversarial machine learning](aml-code)

#### Data:
- Domain adaptation: https://github.com/thuml/CDAN/tree/master/data
- Domain generalization: https://github.com/garyzhao/ME-ADA
- Semi supervised learning: https://github.com/lyakaap/VAT-pytorch, https://github.com/yaodongyu/TRADES
- Adversarial machine learning: https://github.com/yaodongyu/TRADES

#### Reproducing:
Please refer to the bash script (*.sh) in each experiment to reproduce the results

For the running time of our approach, please refer this kernel in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/warkingleo2000/ws-ssl) as we want to utilize the cloud computing service for a fair comparision.
